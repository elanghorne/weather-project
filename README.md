# weather-project
Building a web-based weather app with a C++ backend. Using CPR and nlohmann/json to fetch and parse live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Goal of the project is to get comfortable working with APIs and JSON data while also picking up some frontend skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A fun way to get a feel for Git and GitHub too!
